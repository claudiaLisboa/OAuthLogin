React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
